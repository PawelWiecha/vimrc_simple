In the era of IDE-VIM and 50+ plugins madness I present to you:
## minimal vim config used for working with different remotes
The intention was to provide a starting point for config  
The dir structure works with Vim versions < 8  
It works even with 16/256 TColors  
The only plugins used are verilog/systemverilog syntax and indent guides  
Clone the repo and link your .vimrc to .vimrc provided here  

The vimrc is heavily commented so you can modify it to your needs
